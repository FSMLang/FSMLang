	with 4 events and 3 states
Actions return events
The states :
	2:	s3

	1:	s2

	0:	s1

The events :
	3:	e4

	2:	e3

	1:	e2

	0:	e1

The actions :
	noAction
		which occurs in these events
			e3
			e2
		and states
			s3
			s2
			s1
		and transitions using function transitionFn1
	a2
		which occurs in these events
			e4
		and states
			s3
			s2
		and transitions using function transitionFn
		and returns
			e3
			e2
	a1
		which occurs in these events
			e4
		and states
			s1

		and transitions to state s1

The 3 transitions :
	transitionFn1
	transitionFn
	s1

The 2 transition functions :
	transitionFn1
		which returns
